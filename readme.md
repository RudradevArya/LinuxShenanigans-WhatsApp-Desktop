# Linux Shenanigans :: WhatsApp Desktop Applet

## But WHY??
### Long story short I Shifted to Linux Mint and there was no desktop application for WhatsApp all other seemed a bit sus

#### Just use WhatsApp Web!! Right? 
### No!! 
#### it gets hard to navigate through multiple tabs and windows and browsers to find and as no Desktop App was available i just used a Shell Script to navigate to a browser and open that webpage in its own window basically looking like its own App hence the name Apple

> # **Note**
> ### Any web app can be make using this method (Steam, YouTube on any browser chromium based or fireforx or whatever floats your boat)




### üîß Config Steps

1. Type it into Terminal which'll open Text editor
```sh
sudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/whatsapp-webapp.desktop
```
This might require password, it bascially create a `whatsapp-webapp.desktop` at the destination `/usr/share/applications/` using the gedit text editor

2. Change this path in the `whatsapp-webapp.desktop` file in the script :
```sh
/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome
```
```sh
/usr/bin/firefox
```
or any other chromium based browser u have

3. Change Icon if you wish or the link for the webpage of you choice:

4. Navigate to `/usr/share/applications/` and execute the Shell Script
```sh
sudo chmod +x whatsapp-webapp.desktop
```
and Press enter, there should be no error and no comments
This comment using the Superuser access changes the mode of the file to [e]xecute the Shell Script

# Enjoy
